This half, our team wanted to dedicate some time during the week to learn new things. During these learning blocks, we plan to block out time for learning. Ad hoc requests (I'll call these "tasks" going forward) will not be assigned when the team has a learning block. We want 4 hours per week for learning time, and each learning block should be at least an hour long.

For this project, I'll analyze task data and see which times during the week might be best for team learning blocks. My assumption is that hours during the week with the lowest volume of tasks will be best. These times should have the least impact on our stakeholders, as we'll only pick up these tasks outside of learning blocks. Our organization has teams in 3 regions. I decided to look at data for all regions combined, as well as individually. Data is from an internal table and was stored in the tasks.csv file for this analysis.
